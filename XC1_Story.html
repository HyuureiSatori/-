                In a world of endless ocean, all life lives on the decaying corpses of two gigantic titans, 
                the Bionis and Mechonis. When the army of Mechonis attacks his home, young scientist Shulk sets out for revenge.
                In the beginning, the world had originally been nothing but an endless ocean. 
                That was until two great titans-the Bionis and the Mechonis-came into existence.
                 These two giants fought a timeless battle, until one day only their lifeless bodies 
                 remained, forever locked in combat. Eons later, civilizations founded by races of 
                 Bionis-including the humanoid Homs and the Nopon-came under attack from the Mechon, 
                 a horde of machines from Mechonis. The Homs fought to defend their existence, which would be settled at the
                  Battle of Sword Valley. Armed with the Monado, a legendary blade that can penetrate Mechon armor, the Homs' 
                  hero Dunban fought against the Mechon threat. Those fighting alongside Dunban included Dickson, a seasoned 
                  traveler and old friend of Dunban, and Mumkhar, an honorless soldier who secretly wants the Monado for himself. 
                  During the battle, Dunban was almost overcome by the Monado's power and fell. While Dickson tried to help him, 
                  Mumkhar saw his own chance to escape. While running, he fell down a slope and came face to face with a horde of
                   armed Mechon. Dunban and Dickson, however, recovered quickly, and led a final charge against the approaching Mechon, 
                   completely destroying their army and winning the battle. However, wielding the Monado caused great harm to Dunban's body,
                negating the use of his right arm. Nonetheless, peace was temporarily restored to the colonies.
